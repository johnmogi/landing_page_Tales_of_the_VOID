Install SQLite: You can download SQLite from the official website (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Install Django: You can install Django using pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command: pip install django.

Create a Django project: Once Django is installed, you can create a new project using the django-admin command. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
This will create a new Django project in a directory called myproject.

Create a Django app: In Django, each project consists of one or more apps, which are self-contained modules that can be reused across different projects. To create a new app, run the following command in the terminal:
Copy code
python manage.py startapp myapp
This will create a new app called myapp in a directory with the same name.

Define a model: In Django, models are Python classes that define the fields and behavior of the data you want to store. To define a model for storing subscriber names, open the models.py file in the myapp directory and add the following code:
cpp
Copy code
from django.db import models

class Subscriber(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
This defines a Subscriber model with a single field called name, which is a CharField with a maximum length of 100 characters.

Create a database: Before you can use the Subscriber model to store data, you need to create a database table for it. To do this, run the following command in the terminal:
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
This will create a SQLite database file and the necessary tables for your models.

Test the model: To test the model, you can open the Django shell by running the following command in the terminal:
Copy code
python manage.py shell
This will open a Python shell with access to your Django project. You can then create a new Subscriber object and save it to the database, like this:

python
Copy code
from myapp.models import Subscriber
s = Subscriber(name='John Doe')
s.save()

from myapp.models import Subscriber
s = Subscriber(name='John Doe')
s.save()

This will create a new Subscriber object with the name "John Doe" and save it to the database.

That's it! You now have a basic Django app with a model for storing subscriber names in a SQLite database. From here, you can customize the app and add additional functionality as needed.
